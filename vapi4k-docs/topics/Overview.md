# Overview

We are big fans of [vapi](https://vapi.ai). It is a great platform for building conversational AI applications.
We are also big fans of [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org) and [Ktor](https://ktor.io). We think they are great tools.

Vapi4k is a [Ktor](https://ktor.io) plugin and a [Kotlin DSL](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/type-safe-builders.html)
that makes it easy to define, deploy, and maintain [vapi](https://vapi.ai) applications.

Vapi4k requires knowledge of the vapi API, and a familiarity with [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org) and Ktor. If you are
new to Kotlin, you can learn more about it [here](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/home.html). It is a very easy
language to learn and is a great choice for server-side development. If you are comfortable with JS, Python, or Java,
you will find Kotlin very easy to pick up.

Vapi4k is a work in progress. We are actively developing it and would love to hear your feedback.
If you have any questions, comments, or suggestions, please feel free to reach out to us.

If you go through the [Getting Started](https://mattbobambrose.github.io/vapi4k/getting-started.html) guide, you should
be up and running with an example application less than 15 minutes.
